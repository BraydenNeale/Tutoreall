    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <p>Tutorial Academy was created to make it easy for parents and students to find high quality tutors and make it easy for tutors to provide high quality tutoring to their students. 

    We’ve made it easy to search for a tutor, there’s no more reason to stay on the phone with a tutoring company that middle mans between the tutor and you. With Tutorial Academy you can contact tutors directly to find one that suits your needs!

    Once you’ve found some tutor profiles that you like the look of, you can sign up and directly message them through the platform to discuss your needs.

    The Tutorial Academy platform has a scheduling feature that allows students and tutors to schedule lessons. Once each party has accepted, the lesson is confirmed on the platform and a reminder email is sent to both the tutor and student the day before the lesson!

    We’re currently busy working on building a payment system that allows parents and students to pay the tutor for the lesson with the touch of a button once a lesson is scheduled. We’re aiming to take the hassle out of finding, contacting, scheduling and paying for private tuition.</p>
